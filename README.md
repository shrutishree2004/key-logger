`# Logger Utility

This project is a **Logger Utility** in Python, designed to simplify logging within applications. It allows for streamlined logging of messages with different levels (e.g., info, warning, error) and supports log file creation for persistent records.

## Overview

The logger utility provides:
- Configurable logging levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Optional logging to console and/or file
- Timestamped log entries for tracking events in an application
- Easy integration into other Python scripts

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

If any external libraries are used, include their installation instructions here.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logger-utility.git `

1.  Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd logger-utility`

2.  Import the logger module in your script and configure it:

    python

    Copy code

    `from logger import Logger

    # Example usage
    log = Logger(level="INFO", output_file="app.log")
    log.info("Application started.")
    log.error("An error occurred.")`

### Sample Output

Log output will appear in the console or specified log file in a format such as:

yaml

Copy code

`[2023-01-01 12:00:00] INFO: Application started.
[2023-01-01 12:05:00] ERROR: An error occurred.`

Functionality
-------------

-   **Logger(level, output_file)**: Initializes the logger with specified logging level and optional output file.
-   **info(message)**: Logs an informational message.
-   **warning(message)**: Logs a warning message.
-   **error(message)**: Logs an error message.
